Hello the remote is added and i made a pull from upstream
command : "git pull <upstream_branch_name> <branch_to_pull_into>" 
Fixed the typo to check pull into mayankmohak/Learm_git

Now I will test cherry Pick
Adding new changes into main to  and generate pr Cherry-Pick.
Adding again new changes into main to  and generate pr Cherry-Pick.

I moved the main branch forward and also the cherry pick branch and was able to get back changes on the forked repo.
 - To get newly created branch of cloud(chotu-mayank) i followed:
    - created new branch localy
    - make it tracked to forked repo
    - get changes from upstream [ `git pull upstream <branch_name>` then `git push origin <branch_name>`]
